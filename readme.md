# Domino's Clone - Add to Cart Functionality and UI

This project is a MERN stack-based clone of Domino's pizza add to cart functionality and UI. It allows users to add items to their cart and make orders.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **backend**: This folder contains the server-side code for the application. It handles API requests and business logic.
2. **frontend**: This folder contains the client-side code for the application. It includes the user interface and user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to set up both the backend and frontend.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder using your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/config` folder to store your environment variables, such as  PORT.

   ```
   PORT=4000
   ```

4. Run the server using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev

The backend server should now be up and running on the specified port.
